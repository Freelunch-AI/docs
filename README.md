## Docs

You can checkout our docs in this repository to understand better our vision for the evolution of MLOps.

- Checkout our [AI infra slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fK-ynj6WEG8cIYW3uvg-boNlKQ8-Oevo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103939938195747162766&rtpof=true&sd=true) for a concise and visual explanation of AI infra.

- Checkout [Bruno's Notes](brunos_notes.md) for an in-depth explanation of AI in Production.

The slides are way smaller, easier to understand, and more polished. The Notes have way more stuff with more deetails, but are kinda clunky.
