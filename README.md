## About

Freelunch is an early-stage startup 10xing the ML Engineer. We make open source MLOps tools and sell a Copilot for ML Engineering teams.

## Docs

You can checkout our docs in this repository to understand better our vision for the evolution of MLOps.

- Checkout our [Company Vision Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fK-ynj6WEG8cIYW3uvg-boNlKQ8-Oevo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103939938195747162766&rtpof=true&sd=true) for a concise and visual explanation.

- Checkout our [Design Notes](design_notes.md) for an in-depth explanation of not only *Freelunch*, but also of ML in production (including LLMs).

The slides are easier to understand, more polished and up-to-date, so I'd recommend them first. The Notes have way more stuff but are more clunky and lagging a bit.
